## Getting Started

This repository contains custom Symfony Flex recipes tailored for **neuralglitch** branded Symfony packages and 
packages. To enable recipes defined in this repository for your project, add this endpoint in your project's 
`composer.json` as described in the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex_private_recipes.html#configure-your-project-s-composer-json-file):

```json
{
    "extra": {
        "symfony": {
            "endpoint": [
                "https://api.github.com/repos/symfinity/recipes/contents/index.json",
                "flex://defaults"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Without this option Composer will not use the Symfony Flex recipes for **neuralglitch** branded packages, unless the 
> recipes were contributed to [symfony/recipes-contrib](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib). Then you will 
> need to follow manual installation instructions, if provided. 

> [!NOTE]  
> See [RECIPES.md](https://github.com/symfinity/recipes/blob/flex/main/RECIPES.md) for a full list of 
> recipes that live in this repository.
